# 1.2 Program Are Translated by Other Programs into Different Forms

The hello program begins life as a high-level C program because it can be read and understood by human beings in that form. However, in order to run hello.c on the system, the individual C statements must be translated by other programs into a sequence of low-level machine-language instructions. These instructions are then packaged in a form called an executable object program and stored as a binary disk file. Object programs are also referred to as executable object files.

On a Unix system, the translation from source file to object file is performed by a **compiler driver**:

`linux> gcc -o hello hello.c`

Here, the gcc compiler driver reads the source file hello.c and translates it into an executable object file hello. The translation is performed in the sequence of four phases shown in Figure 1.3. The programs that perform the four phases (**preprocessor**, **compiler**, **assembler**, and **linker**) are known collectively as the compilation system.

* **Preprocessing phase**. The preprocessor (cpp) modifies the original C program according to directives that begin with the ‘#’ character. For example, the `#include <stdio.h>` command in line 1 of hello.c tells the preprocessor to read the contents of the system header file stdio.h and insert it directly into the program text. The result is another C program, typically with the .i suffix.
* **Compilation phase**. The compiler (cc1) translates the text file hello.i into the text file hello.s, which contains an assembly-language program. This program includes the following definition of function main:
*   ```bash
    main:
        subq $8, %rsp
        movl $.LC0, %edi
        call puts
        movl $0, %eax
        addq $8, %rsp
        ret
    ```

    Each of lines 2–7 in this definition describes one low-level machinelanguage instruction in a textual form. Assembly language is useful because it provides a common output language for different compilers for different high-level languages. For example, C compilers and Fortran compilers both generate output files in the same assembly language.
* **Assembly phase**. Next, the assembler (as) translates hello.s into machinelanguage instructions, packages them in a form known as a relocatable object program, and stores the result in the object file hello.o. This file is a binary file containing 17 bytes to encode the instructions for function main. If we were to view hello.o with a text editor, it would appear to be gibberish.
* **Linking phase**. Notice that our hello program calls the `printf` function, which is part of the standard C library provided by every C compiler. The `printf` function resides in a separate precompiled object file called printf.o, which must somehow be merged with our hello.o program. The linker (ld) handles this merging. The result is the hello file, which is an executable object file (or simply executable) that is ready to be loaded into memory and executed by the system

#### Aside --- The GNU project

Gcc is one of many useful tools developed by the GNU (short for GNU’s Not Unix) project. The GNU project is a tax-exempt charity started by Richard Stallman in 1984, with the ambitious goal of developing a complete Unix-like system whose source code is unencumbered by restrictions on how it can be modified or distributed. The GNU project has developed an environment with all the major components of a Unix operating system, except for the kernel, which was developed separately by the Linux project. The GNU environment includes the emacs editor, gcc compiler, gdb debugger, assembler, linker, utilities for manipulating binaries, and other components. The gcc compiler has grown to support many different languages, with the ability to generate code for many different machines. Supported languages include C, C++, Fortran, Java, Pascal, Objective-C, and Ada.&#x20;

The GNU project is a remarkable achievement, and yet it is often overlooked. The modern opensource movement (commonly associated with Linux) owes its intellectual origins to the GNU project’s notion of free software (“free” as in “free speech,” not “free beer”). Further, Linux owes much of its popularity to the GNU tools, which provide the environment for the Linux kernel.
