# 1.4 Processors Read and Interpert Instructions Stored in Memory

At this point, our hello.c source program has been translated by the compilation system into an executable object file called hello that is stored on disk. To run the executable file on a Unix system, we type its name to an application program known as a shell:

```
linux> ./hello
hello, world
linux> 
```

The shell is a command-line interpreter that prints a prompt, waits for you to type a command line, and then performs the command. If the first word of the command line does not correspond to a built-in shell command, then the shell assumes that it is the name of an executable file that it should load and run. So in this case, the shell loads and runs the hello program and then waits for it to terminate. The hello program prints its message to the screen and then terminates. The shell then prints a prompt and waits for the next input command line.

## 1.4.1 Hardware Organization of a System <a href="#1" id="1"></a>

To understand what happens to our hello program when we run it, we need to understand the hardware organization of a typical system, which is shown in Figure 1.4. This particular picture is modeled after the family of recent Intel systems, but all systems have a similar look and feel. Don’t worry about the complexity of this figure just now. We will get to its various details in stages throughout the course of the book.

### 1. Buses <a href="#1-1" id="1-1"></a>

Running throughout the system is a collection of electrical conduits called buses that carry bytes of information back and forth between the components. Buses are typically designed to transfer fixed-size chunks of bytes known as **words**. The number of bytes in a word (the **word size**) is a fundamental system parameter that varies across systems. Most machines today have word sizes of either 4 bytes (32 bits) or 8 bytes (64 bits). In this book, we do not assume any fixed definition of word size. Instead, we will specify what we mean by a “word” in any context that requires this to be defined.

### 2. I/O Devices <a href="#1-2" id="1-2"></a>

Input/output (I/O) devices are the system’s connection to the external world. Our example system has four I/O devices: a keyboard and mouse for user input, a display for user output, and a disk drive (or simply disk) for long-term storage of data and programs. Initially, the executable hello program resides on the disk.&#x20;

Each I/O device is connected to the I/O bus by either a controller or an adapter. The distinction between the two is mainly one of packaging. Controllers are chip sets in the device itself or on the system’s main printed circuit board (often called the motherboard). An adapter is a card that plugs into a slot on the motherboard. Regardless, the purpose of each is to transfer information back and forth between the I/O bus and an I/O device.&#x20;

Chapter 6 has more to say about how I/O devices such as disks work. In Chapter 10, you will learn how to use the Unix I/O interface to access devices from your application programs. We focus on the especially interesting class of devices known as networks, but the techniques generalize to other kinds of devices as well.

### 3. Main Memory

The main memory is a temporary storage device that holds both a program and the data it manipulates while the processor is executing the program. Physically, main memory consists of a collection of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips. Logically, memory is organized as a linear array of bytes, each with its own unique address (array index) starting at zero. In general, each of the machine instructions that constitute a program can consist of a variable number of bytes. The sizes of data items that correspond to C program variables vary according to type. For example, on an x86-64 machine running Linux, data of type short require 2 bytes, types int and float 4 bytes, and types long and double 8 bytes.

Chapter 6 has more to say about how memory technologies such as DRAM chips work, and how they are combined to form main memory.

### 4. Processor

The **central processing unit (CPU)**, or simply processor, is the engine that interprets (or executes) instructions stored in main memory. At its core is a word-size storage device (or **register**) called the **program counter (PC)**. At any point in time, the PC points at (contains the address of) some machine-language instruction in main memory.

{% hint style="info" %}
PC is also a commonly used acronym for “personal computer.” However, the distinction between the two should be clear from the context.
{% endhint %}

From the time that power is applied to the system until the time that the power is shut off, a processor repeatedly executes the instruction pointed at by the program counter and updates the program counter to point to the next instruction. A processor appears to operate according to a very simple instruction execution model, defined by itsinstruction set architecture. In this model, instructions execute in strict sequence, and executing a single instruction involves performing a series of steps. The processor reads the instruction from memory pointed at by the program counter (PC), interprets the bits in the instruction, performs some simple operation dictated by the instruction, and then updates the PC to point to the next instruction, which may or may not be contiguous in memory to the instruction that was just executed.

There are only a few of these simple operations, and they revolve around main memory, the **register file**, and the **arithmetic/logic unit (ALU)**. The register file is a small storage device that consists of a collection of word-size registers, each with its own unique name. The ALU computes new data and address values. Here are some examples of the simple operations that the CPU might carry out at the request of an instruction:

* **Load**: Copy a byte or a word from main memory into a register, overwriting the previous contents of the register.
* **Store**: Copy a byte or a word from a register to a location in main memory, overwriting the previous contents of that location.
* **Operate**: Copy the contents of two registers to the ALU, perform an arithmetic operation on the two words, and store the result in a register, overwriting the previous contents of that register.
* **Jump**: Extract a word from the instruction itself and copy that word into the program counter (PC), overwriting the previous value of the PC.

We say that a processor appears to be a simple implementation of its **instruction set architecture**, but in fact modern processors use far more complex mechanisms to speed up program execution. Thus, we can distinguish the processor’s instruction set architecture, describing the effect of each machine-code instruction, from its **microarchitecture**, describing how the processor is actually implemented. When we study machine code in Chapter 3, we will consider the abstraction provided by the machine’s instruction set architecture. Chapter 4 has more to say about how processors are actually implemented. Chapter 5 describes a model of how modern processors work that enables predicting and optimizing the performance of machine-language programs.

## 1.4.2 Running the hello Program <a href="#2" id="2"></a>

Given this simple view of a system’s hardware organization and operation, we can begin to understand what happens when we run our example program. We must omit a lot of details here that will be filled in later, but for now we will be content with the big picture.

Initially, the shell program is executing its instructions, waiting for us to type a command. As we type the characters ./hello at the keyboard, the shell program reads each one into a register and then stores it in memory, as shown in Figure 1.5.

![Figure 1.5 Reading the hello command from the keyboard.](<../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png>)

When we hit the enter key on the keyboard, the shell knows that we have finished typing the command. The shell then loads the executable hello file by executing a sequence of instructions that copies the code and data in the hello object file from disk to main memory. The data includes the string of characters `hello, world\n` that will eventually be printed out.

Using a technique known as **direct memory access** (**DMA**, discussed in Chapter 6), the data travel directly from disk to main memory, without passing through the processor. This step is shown in Figure 1.6.

![Figure 1.6 Loading the executable from disk into main memory](<../.gitbook/assets/image (17) (1).png>)

Once the code and data in the hello object file are loaded into memory, the processor begins executing the machine-language instructions in the hello program’s main routine. These instructions copy the bytes in the hello, world\n string from memory to the register file, and from there to the display device, where they are displayed on the screen. This step is shown in Figure 1.7.
